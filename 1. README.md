# Data-Science-Project
The raw data set contains a credit union's customer information with a sample size of 1000 and 35 variables. The data set is limited to British Columbia.
The data analysis was implemented in the following four phases using the tools, including R Studio and Excel:
   Data exploration: Explore the data set provided by Prospera, and additional data gathered to find patterns and profile their customers.
   Data wrangling: Cleaned the raw dataset, identified gaps in the data, and applied appropriate methods to resolve the issues. The cleaned dataset was used for the analysis.
   Data modeling: Various statistical and nonstatistical techniques were implemented to understand different features and patterns in the dataset. Prediction and classification      models were developed according to the research objectives.
   Data visualization:
   Various charts, graphs, and tables were used to graphically represent the analysis. Important trends and patterns in the data were recognized and presented through the data        visualization.
Methods used for data modeling
Random forest &
Kmeans clustering
The outliers in the data were removed and normalization was performed as a feature scaling method. 
In kmeans clustering, the optimal k (4) was obtained by silhoutte method and elbow method. 
The efficiency of the kmeans algorith was around 63%, which was quite better than re-sampled and over-sampled data. 
The clustered data was saved and imported as a new file to further analyze clusters. 
Recommendations were made to the credit union based on the cluster inferences. 
The below is the r code for data set creation and the project.
