* This project is part of Data Science Capestone project at Okanagan College. 

* The raw data set contains a credit union's customer information with a sample size of 1000 and 35 variables. The data set is limited to British Columbia, Canada.

* The data analysis was implemented in the following four phases:

    * Data Exploration: The credit union's data set was analysed using SPSS for correlations. Weak correlations were found between the variables. Analysed demographics, which was further used in the reporting.  
    * Data wrangling: Libraries including dplyr and lubridate were used to further clean the data. Unified date formats and missing values were taken care of. Hot encoding was done to the categorical variables to ease up the analysis. 
    * Data modeling: Kmeans clustering, an unsupervised model was used to cluster the credit union's data. Four clusters were recognised using silhoutte and elbow method. 
    * Data visualization: Pie charts, bar graphs, and tables were used to graphically represent the analysis. Excel was used for data visualization and reporting purposes.
* Outcome: The efficiency of the kmeans algorith was around 63%, which was quite better than re-sampled and over-sampled data. The clustered data was saved and imported as a new file to further analyze clusters. Recommendations were made to the credit union based on the cluster inferences.
